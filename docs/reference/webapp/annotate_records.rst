Annotate Records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The **Annotation mode** enables users to add and modify annotations, while following the same interaction patterns as in the `explore mode <explore_records.rst>`_\ (e.g., using filters and advanced search).

Novel features, such as **bulk annotation** for a given set of search parameters are also available. 

Users can validate or discard from 5 to 20 records at the same time, depending on how many records per page are being displayed.

It is also posible to create new labels for any classification task (tokenization, text classification...), and results can be validated or discarded. Also, the **Refresh** button (which is available in both modes) is very helpful when it comes to update recent changes made on the dataset.

In both modes (**Explore** and **Annotation**), the **Metrics** menu is available. Learn more about it `here <metrics.rst>`_\

Annotation by different users will be saved with different annotation agents.
To setup various users in your Rubrix server, please refer to our `user management guide <../getting_started/user-management.ipynb>`_.
