View Dataset Metrics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The **Dataset Metrics** are part of the **Sidebar** placed on the right side of **Rubrix datasets**. To know more about this component, click `here <dataset_main.rst>`_\.

Rubrix metrics are very convenient in terms of assesing the status of the dataset, and to extract more valuable information.

How to use Metrics
---------
Metrics are composed of two submenus: **Progress** and **Stats**. They work similarly in **Annotation** and **Explore** and **Define rules** mode.

Progress
~~~~~~~~~~
This submenu is useful when users need to know how many records are annotated, validated and/or discarded. 

When clicking on this menu, not only the progress is shown, but users can also check the number of labels, and how many records belong to each one.

Stats
~~~~~~~~~~
This submenu allows users to know more about the keywords and the error distribution of the dataset. 

It is composed of a dropdown with the two options (**Keywords** and **Error Distribution**).

The **Keywords** dropdown displays a list of annotated words and the number of occurrences, while the **Error Distribution** dropdown displays a pie chart with the number of records, and the number of correct and incorrect predictions. 

Refresh button
~~~~~~~~~~
Users should click this button whenever they would like to see the page updated. If changes are made, this button displays the page updated.
