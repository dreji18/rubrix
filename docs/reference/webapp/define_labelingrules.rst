Define Labeling Rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The **Define Rules** mode is a feature available for **Text Classification Tasks**.

This mode creates **labeling rules** for easily accessing some specific contents. By creating rules, users can see not only the corresponding results, but also features like coverage, precision, correct/incorrect records, and so on.

The interface can be divided in three parts for this mode:

- **How it works**,
- **Rules**,
- **Filter and search**
- and **Sidebar and metrics**

More detailed information about these features can be found `here <dataset_main.rst>`_\. This section will explain the actions related to exploring records.

How it works
---------
After opening a dataset, the **Define Rules** mode must be chosen on the sidebar.

If it is chosen, a **queries searchbar** is displayed on the superior part of the dataset. Below, users will see the **Rules Menu** with the following features:

- **Labels**: the labels are the ones available for the dataset. More labels can be created with the **Annotation** mode.
- **Coverage**: the coverage obtained by the created query.
- **Annotated coverage**: the coverage obtained by the created query after annotation.
- **Correct**: the number of correct results.
- **Incorrect**: the number of incorrect results.
- **Precision**: the precision obtained by the query.

For checking the results obtained by a query, users must type on the queries searchbar and press intro when finished.

After that, **labels** will appear as editable and one of them can be chosen. Finally, results will be displayed on screen and the rule can be saved by clicking on the **Save rule** button.

Manage Rules
~~~~~~~~~~
Rules can be edited by selecting them on the **Manage rules** menu, located on the right hand side of the **Rules menu**.

After clicking here, a menu with the **Overall Metrics** for the dataset and a table with the created rules will be displayed.

Here, users can search rules by name, delete or update them.

Filters and search
---------
Due to the operability of this mode, `filtering <filter_records.rst>`_\  and   `searching records <search_records.rst>`_\  are not available as features. The queries itself work as filters and searchers.

More information about these features can be found  `here <dataset_main.rst>`_\, and their use is described  `here <filter_records.rst>`_\.

Sidebar and metrics
---------
In all modes (**Explore**, **Annotation** and **Define rules**), the **Metrics** menu is available on the sidebar. Learn more about it  `here <dataset_main.rst>`_\  (features) or  `here <metrics.rst>`_\  (an "user guide").
