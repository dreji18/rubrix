Define Labeling Rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The **Define Rules** mode is a feature available for **Text Classification Tasks**.

This mode creates **labeling rules** for easily accessing some specific contents. By creating rules, users can see not only the corresponding results, but also features like coverage, precision, correct/incorrect records, and so on.

How it works
---------
After opening a dataset, the **Define Rules** mode must be chosen on the sidebar.

If it is chosen, a **queries searchbar** is displayed on the superior part of the dataset, and below, users will see the following:

- **Labels**: the labels are the ones available for the dataset. More labels can be created with the **Annotation** mode.
- **Coverage**
- **Annotated coverage**
- **Correct**
- **Incorrect**
- **Precision**


Filters and search
---------
Due to the operability of this mode, `filtering <filter_records.rst>`_\  and   `searching records <search_records.rst`_\  are not available as features. The queries itself work as filters and searchers.

More information about these features can be found  `here <dataset_main.rst>`_\, and their use is described  `here <filter_records.rst>`_\.

Sidebar and metrics
---------
In all modes (**Explore**, **Annotation** and **Define rules**), the **Metrics** menu is available on the sidebar. Learn more about it  `here <dataset_main.rst>`_\  (features) or  `here <metrics.rst>`_\  (an "user guide").
