Dataset
==========
The **Dataset page** is the workspace for exploring and annotating records in a Rubrix dataset. Every task has its own specialized components, while keeping a similar layout and structure.

The search components and the two modes of operation (Explore and Annotation) are described below.

The Rubrix dataset page is driven by **search features**. The **search records bar** gives users quick filters for easily exploring and selecting data subsets.

The main sections of the search bar are following:

- *Record cards*
