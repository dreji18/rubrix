Annotate Records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In terms of annotating records, the **Annotation mode** enables users to add and modify annotations. This mode follows the same interaction patterns as in the `explore mode <explore_records.rst>`_\ (e.g., using filters and advanced search).

Novel features, such as **bulk annotation** for a given set of search parameters are also available. 

How to annotate
---------
This section is intended to explain how the **Annotation Mode** works.

When choosing this mode, the display of the dataset is slightly different. 



Bulk Annotation
---------
With this feature, users can validate or discard from 5 to 20 records at the same time, depending on how many records per page are being displayed.

It is also posible to create new labels for any classification task (tokenization, text classification...), and results can be validated or discarded.

Metrics
---------
In both modes (**Explore** and **Annotation**), the **Metrics** menu is available. Learn more about it `here <dataset_main.rst>`_\.

Annotation by different users will be saved with different annotation agents.
To setup various users in your Rubrix server, please refer to our `user management guide <../getting_started/user-management.ipynb>`_.
