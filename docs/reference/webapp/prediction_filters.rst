Predictions filters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This component allows filtering by aspects related to predictions, such as:

- **predicted as**: for filtering records by predicted labels,
- **predicted by**: for filtering by prediction_agent (e.g., different versions of a model),
- **predicted ok or ko**: for filtering records whose predictions are (or not) correct with respect to the annotations,
- **score**: for inspecting the score of a negative or positive label. Although this feature is displayed in all datasets, is only effective for results involving percentage or numbers (watch this, this or this tutorial to know more.)
