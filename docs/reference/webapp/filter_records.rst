Filter Records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
With this component, users are able to sort the information on the dataset by different parameters (see `here <dataset_main.rst>`_\).

Since Rubrix can carry out different types of tasks, filters are different for each of them. Besides, filtering records can be used in both **Annotation** and **Exploration** modes.
