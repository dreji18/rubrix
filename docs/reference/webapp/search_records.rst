How to search on Rubrix records
---------
As stated above, searching records can be done by full-text queries (a normal search), or by Elasticsearch queries with its `query string syntax <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax>`_\.

In both **Annotation** and **Exploration** modes, the searchbar is placed in the upper left-hand corner. To search something, users must type one or several words (or a query) and click the intro button. After that, corresponding records will be displayed.  

Note that this feature also works as a kind of filter, as if users search something, it is possible to explore and/or annotate the results obtained. Besides, more `filters <filter_records.rst>`_\  can be applied.
