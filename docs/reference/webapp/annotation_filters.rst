Annotation filters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This component allows filtering by aspects related to annotations. This can be very useful when it comes to handle a lot of data.

The different filters are the following:

- **annotated as**: for filtering records by annotated labels. Several labels can be selected, and if an user creates a new one, it will be shown on the drop down.
- **annotated by**: for filtering by annotation_agent (e.g., different human users or dataset versions). This agent can be established when programming ``Records``.
