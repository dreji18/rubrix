Switch Workspaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This feature turns out very convenient when users need to use different workspaces for different purposes.

The **switch workspace** menu is located in the upper right-hand corner (where the user icon is shown) of both **workspace** and **dataset** pages, and will display the different workspaces available for the user. 

If an user wants to switch the workspace to another one, they must clic on the user icon and select another one. This will drive the user to the main page of the **workspace**.
