Metadata filters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This component allows filtering by metadata fields. 

The list of **metadata categories** is dynamic and it's created with the aggregation of metadata fields included in any of the logged records.

Several filters can be chosen in order to see different metadata, and it will display a result of records with the same metadata category.
